# here we learn hoe to use list in python : we use [] that bracket for listing

days_of_week = ["monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday","sunday"]
# let's do listing
print(days_of_week)

# length of days_of_week

print(len(days_of_week))

# let's try indexing

print(days_of_week[0])
print(days_of_week[-1])

# let's use f

print(f"this the {days_of_week[2]} third day of week")
